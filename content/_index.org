I am an applied mathematician and a software engineer. My beat is public health - I work at the intersection of public health and analytics. I develop methods and tools to support outbreak response, and am currently working on a whole health-sysem model (Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model). I am a Research Fellow at Imperial College London.
